# LegoStudioHelper
A small app to rebuild corrupted Lego studio instruction manuals.

One of the biggest frustrations for LEGO developers using Lego Studio is how it can ruin or corrupt a carefully set-up instruction manual when you make changes to your build. After running into this issue several times, I decided take a deepdive into the .io files and created a small app that can restore a corrupted instruction manualâ€”provided you have a good backup.
In \src your can find the python source.
In \dist you can find the compiled exe file.

If you enjoys the app, you can support me by buying my [cup of coffee](https://rebrickable.com/users/Terraxz/mocs/)
