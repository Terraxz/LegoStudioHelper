A small app to rebuild corrupted Lego studio instruction manuals.

One of the biggest frustrations for LEGO developers using Lego Studio is how it can ruin or corrupt a carefully set-up instruction manual when you make changes to your build. After running into this issue several times, I decided take a deepdive into the .io files and created a small app that can restore a corrupted instruction manual—provided you have a good backup.

If you enjoys the app, you can support me by buying my “cup of coffee.”
